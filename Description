Description Early Detection of Dementia Using Machine Learning...........................................................................................................................

This project aims to enhance early detection of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease, through the integration of machine learning techniques and brain MRI imaging. 
By leveraging artificial neural networks (ANN) with a Multilayer Perceptron architecture, the model classifies individuals based on demographic, clinical, and morphometric data. 
The dataset, sourced from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), includes 235 instances, with variables such as age, sex, cognitive assessments, and MRI-derived brain 
volume measurements. Image processing and Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) techniques are applied to refine the dataset and reduce confusion errors.

Tasks....................................................................................................................................................................................

Developed and Implemented Machine Learning Model: Led the development of a Logistic Regression model to classify binary outcomes, achieving high accuracy (96.67%) and AUC (0.99) 
on a test set. Performed extensive data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation to ensure robust model performance.

Enhanced Model Performance with Evaluation Metrics: Utilized key classification metrics, including precision (97.22%), recall (96.30%), and F1-score (96.59%), 
to evaluate and optimize model performance. Applied these insights to balance the trade-off between false positives and false negatives, enhancing the model's predictive capability.

Streamlined Results Reporting and Visualization: Designed and implemented a systematic approach to update and track model performance using a scorecard. 
Visualized key metrics to communicate model effectiveness to stakeholders, providing clear insights into the model's strengths and areas for improvement.

Results of Early Detection of Dementia Using Machine Learning.............................................................................................................................

The Logistic Regression model demonstrated excellent performance on the test set, achieving the following key metrics:

Accuracy: 96.67%

The model correctly predicted 96.67% of the test samples, indicating a high overall correctness in classification. AUC Score: 0.99

The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is 0.994878, suggesting that the model has a very high ability to distinguish between the two classes. 
An AUC value close to 1 signifies that the model is performing almost perfectly. Precision: 97.22%

Precision, which measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made, is 97.22%. This means that when the model predicts a positive outcome, 
it is correct 97.22% of the time. Recall: 96.30%

Recall, or sensitivity, indicates that the model correctly identifies 96.30% of the actual positive cases. 
This is a strong result, reflecting the modelâ€™s ability to minimize false negatives. F1-Score: 96.59%

The F1-Score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is 96.59%. 
This indicates a balanced performance in terms of both precision and recall, without favoring one over the other.

Conclusion: The Logistic Regression model has shown excellent performance across all major metrics, 
with particularly strong results in terms of AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
Its high accuracy and AUC score indicate that it is well-suited for distinguishing between the two classes. 
These results suggest that the model is robust and effective, though further tuning or testing on additional datasets may further optimize its performance.
